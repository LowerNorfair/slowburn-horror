The thudding sound of your heartbeat wakes you in the middle of the night. For a moment you are immobile, your ears pulsing with blood and tinnitus, a sharp pain over your left side. 
Your wide eyes pull in the bright moonlight casting through a window. The texture of your bedroom ceiling gradually materialises, as does the low ache that runs down the curve of your spine from hours of resting against the hardwood floor.
This is not an uncommon occurrence. In fact, for as long as you can remember you have been unable to sleep through the night, waking in the small hours with your heart thudding violently against the inside of your chest.
A light headache begins to form behind your eyes as your restless body forces you upright.
