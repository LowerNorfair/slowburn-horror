You thrash about in fear, quickly becoming claustrophobic under the weight. But then your arm is free, not even as a release, but as though it was never held to begin with. 
The thing lies as still as ever, and you pull away. You hear your own laboured breathing, your pulse in your ear as when you were woken. 
You find your body immobile, and close your eyes again to block out the sight. A slightly hysterical laugh bubbles up in your chest, then fades. You needed this, didnâ€™t you? No, you remember, wanted.
You feel again the exhausted calm of sleeplessness, your nerves are shaking with it. You lay down, half collapse, against the floor. The ache in your back throbs back into the forefront as your weight pushes your spine flat against the hardwood. 
You hear your pulse in your ears still, the noisy ringing of silence. The thing sleeps too.
