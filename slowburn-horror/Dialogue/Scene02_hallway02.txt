You walk for a while down the dark hallway, until your body abruptly stops. Your neck compulsorily tilts your eyeline up to the still drawstring that opens the hatch to the attic.
As you stare with your sore, bleary eyes, you feel your body drawn to something waiting in that room, as it has every night before. You cannot remember when it started. You can't even remember what you are looking for.
Something important. Something lost. 
The lack of sleep is not helping matters.
