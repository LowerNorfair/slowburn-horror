You reach your hands into the box. They are shaking, probably from the insomnia, or the cold. 
The mass feels cool and wet as you push your fingers lovingly into it’s meat. The flesh yields beneath your claws and sucks your hand down into it’s viscous body.
You close your eyes and let the sensation of your skin drowning in the soft mass override your other senses. It slowly matches your temperature as you sink up to the arm, gentle wet fat lodging beneath your nails.
You lose more and more awareness as the mass takes in your shoulders, chest, stomach. It begins to feel warm around you, the ache of your tightly shut eyes eases, your bare face feels wet.
Then abruptly the mass is cold and slightly stiff again. You start to panic and try to tug your torso free, but it is stuck.
You open your eyes and look at the dark, formless shape. Is this... What have you done. What have you done. What have you done!
